# CI224_Semester2 

To create a simple world in OpenGL and generate objects that could obstruct the players vision and movement. The world could be interactive and be controlled with mouse and keyboard. The aim of the project would be to create similar game to minecraft, that allows the player to roam freely and jump on objects and hit them to create a path.

# Proposed Technology 

- Collision dection
- Simple ballistics 
- Level genertion and storage

# Marking Scheme 

- 25% - For well commented code and indentation. 
- 25% - Implementation of game idea - you may wish
to provide original sketches of your idea as evidence
for this.
- 50% - Working game level and ability to move around in the world freely
